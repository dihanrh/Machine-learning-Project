Machine Learning: Supervised Prediction of House Price Based on Data Set Inside Dhaka City

Introduction:
Machine Learning (ML) is a field that belongs to Data Science. ML is a computational Statistics method which works to figure out efficient value on certain set of Data. Data can be discreate or in well manner. Severe task of ML algorithm is to build a model called as training data followed by some set of rules to reach at the prediction or decision. 
Prediction in ML is to decide having numeric or string value. Most of the cases the value can be visualized or can be represented by pictorial data. Overall resulting output in ML is computed using algorithm that can receive argument and returns value to machine. Supervised Machine Learning technique implies that machine is trained by some sort of data, that is cleaned and labelled and based on the data the machine can predict output.
In this report, Supervised Machine Learning technique has been mostly used to figure out a predicting. Reinforcement is merely used in some scenario where it was efficient to handle the algorithm for efficient prediction.
Houses Price of Dhaka City has been used as data set. In this report around 13000 houses information has been studied to trained the machine for building model. As the houses price depend on demographic, geographic and region, so the entire built program can predict only for the limited area. But it can be used widely in case to predict data with some modification.

Future Work:
House price prediction in Dhaka city is mostly important for development and real estate companies which operates business in Dhaka city. Alongside, buyers can also justify and plan to purchase their desired house by just clicking well designed UI/UX of the model. Dhaka is one of the fastest growing cities in Bangladesh.  The housing plan is highly demand for all the times. It can be used in to analyze the performance of real estate business and development. 
 
 
Conclusion:
Machine Learning is a combination that is consisted of several concept of mathematics, computational statistics, python distributions and after all analytics. It has been used widely to figure out, estimate, forecaster, predict and analyze from a dig data set.
Prediction using ML depends on the technique and algorithm used in data frame. Decision tree, Linear Regression and Feature Engineering has been used to make the data set or data frame eligible for training.  After all, the machine can return some value for each query.
